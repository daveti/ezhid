  Introduction

   The amikbd module is a firmware package for the EZ-USB device that
   interfaces between the serial communication protocol of an Amiga
   A2000/A3000 keyboard and the USB HID driver of any operating system.
   Supporting the USB boot protocol for keyboards, it can be attached as
   the primary keyboard to modern computers.

  Compilation

   Change to the amikbd/src directory and type

   make

   You will need a recent version of SDCC, so it is a good idea to
   check-out the latest code from the repository or donwload a snapshot.
   The hex-file can be downloaded directly to the EZ-USB device using
   your preferred method. The firmware supports both downloading into the
   device RAM or being bootloaded from a programmed serial I2C EEPROM on
   the board. In the latter case, you'll have to add the option
   -DROM_FIRMWARE in Makefile. After having compiled the source code to
   suit the needs of the bootloading, run create_ezhid_e2.pl on the
   compiled hex-file. The output of create_ezhid_e2.pl has the correct
   format for the onbaord I2C EEPROM.
   The benefit of having the firmware permanently in the EEPROM is that
   most modern motherboards detect the USB keyboard boot protocol and
   include the keyboard at system boot time. Moreover, you do not have to
   set up a firmware downloader for every operating system you happen to
   use on your computer.

  Adapter Hardware

   There is not much hardware required to attach the Amiga keyboard to
   the EZ-USB board. You will need an appropriate connector and an
   external 5V power source.

   Wiring Diagram for the Amiga Keyboard (amikbd.png)
   Keyboard KCLK (1) is connected to PC4 and keyboard KDAT (2) to PC5.
   This assignment is arbitrary as the serial transfer code bit-bangs
   over any general-purpose IO-ports. If the default pins don't suit your
   needs, you can alter the macros in amikbd.h accordingly.
