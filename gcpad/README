  Introduction

   The gcpad module is a firmware package for the EZ-USB device that
   manages up to four Gamecube controllers. It makes them available as
   generic gamepads to any computer system that supports the HID class of
   the USB standard. Modern computer systems should be able to recognize
   this bundle and to attach it seamlessly to the set of input devices
   for game control. There should be even no need for specific drivers as
   the HUT gamepad characteristics are well-defined inside the HID
   specification. The generic driver of any operating system should do
   the job.
   It has been tested with Linux 2.4.22 so far, which implements joystick
   handling within the joydev module. In case this module is not loaded
   automatically, consult the documentation of your distribution on how
   to activate this module.

  Restrictions

   Some restrictions apply when using this module. Not everything has
   been tested yet and I do not know which flaws are still present. The
   firmware is known to play well with the original controller and
   certain clones. It definitely works with a "BigBen Interactive" clone.

  Compilation and Installing

   The file gcpad.ihx contains a compiled version of the firmware based
   of the released source files. You need the [1]SDCC compiler suite if
   you want to modify the sources.
   Once it is installed, issue

   make

   The hex-file can be downloaded directly to the EZ-USB device using
   your preferred method. The firmware supports both downloading into the
   device RAM or being bootloaded from a programmed serial I2C EEPROM on
   the board. In the latter case you'll have to set the variable ROM_FW
   accordingly in Makefile. After having compiled the source code to suit
   the needs of the bootloading, run create_ezhid_e2.pl on the compiled
   hex-file. The output of create_ezhid_e2.pl has the correct format for
   the onbaord I2C EEPROM.

   The benefit of having the firmware permanently in the EEPROM is that
   you do not have to set up a firmware downloader for every operating
   system you happen to use on your computer.

  Adapter Hardware

   The Gamecube controller connector is quite straight forward. It uses
   three pins for power supply (+5.0V, +3.43V and GND) and one pin for
   the data signal. Please note that the voltages were measured at two
   PAL consoles only, so it is a good idea to verify if their values
   match your paticular console. Here's a schematic how to connect the
   controllers:
   I am not 100% sure about the value of the four resitors. I followed
   the description of [2]crema and they worked for me.

   The assignment to the EZ-USB ports is arbitrary. It can be changed by
   modifying the #define statements in pad_port.h.
   Although some references for the Gamecube controller mention the
   supply voltage to be 3.43V it seems not to be mandatory to stick
   exactly to this voltage. I use the 3.3V on-board supply which works
   well with my controllers.
   If you are lucky you can find a matching connector and wire this to
   the EZ-USB device. Alternatively, you can reuse an externsion cable
   and replace the connector which plugs into the console by a standard
   male connector. The matching female connector is then connected to the
   EZ-USB according to the above schematic. 5-Pin DIN connectors are well
   suited, cheap and provide compatibility with extension cables for old
   keyboards. You can share the adapter hardware of an [3]N64 controller
   and add the 5.0V supply to a spare pin.
   Once the firmware is downloaded and installed, the HID subsystem
   should report four new gamepad devices. Each controller has eight axes
   (analog joystick, analog C-joystick, digital pad, L and R) and 8
   buttons. The buttons are assigned in the following way:

   Gamecube Button | Gamepad Button
   ----------------+---------------
   A               | 0
   B               | 1
   Y               | 2
   X               | 3
   Z               | 4
   Start           | 5
   L               | 6
   R               | 7
